Human: ## Task: Matrix-to-Contract Comparison - Batch 2 (Matrix items 4.2.8 through 5.1.5)

You are a legal analyst comparing Bank standard matrix requirements against a counterparty acquiring contract.

### Input files:
- `/inputs/matrix.json` - Bank standard matrix (use `number` as matrix id)
- `/inputs/contract.txt` - Counterparty contract text
- `/outputs/working/clause_index.json` - Source map
- `/outputs/working/legal_propositions.json` - Legal proposition ledger
- `/outputs/working/contract_locator_registry.json` - Contract locator registry (use only `final_allowed=true` locators as contract_ids)

### Contract Profile:
- Product: trade_acquiring
- Lot: 44_fz (government contract under 44-FZ)
- Terminal: pos, smart
- Payment method: card, qr
- Legal regime: 44_fz
- Parties: "Заказчик" = Enterprise/Предприятие, "Исполнитель" = Bank

### Your task:
Analyze these matrix items against the FULL contract text. For each applicable evaluable matrix item, find true legal analogues in the contract.

Matrix items to analyze (Batch 2):
4.2.8, 4.2.9, 4.2.10, 4.2.11, 4.2.12, 4.2.13, 4.2.14, 4.2.15, 4.2.16.1, 4.2.16.2, 4.2.16.3, 4.2.17, 4.2.18, 4.2.19, 4.2.20.1, 4.2.20.2, 4.2.20.3, 4.2.20.4, 4.2.20.5, 4.2.20.6, 4.2.20.7, 4.2.21.1, 4.2.21.2, 4.2.21.3, 4.2.21.4, 4.2.21.5, 4.2.21.6, 4.2.21.7, 4.2.21.8, 4.2.22, 4.2.23, 4.2.24, 4.2.25, 4.2.26, 5.1.1.1, 5.1.1.2, 5.1.1.3, 5.1.1.4, 5.1.1.5, 5.1.1.6, 5.1.2, 5.1.3, 5.1.4, 5.1.5

### Applicability filtering:
- If `only_for_product` is not "common" and doesn't match "trade_acquiring" or "internet_acquiring", mark as `out_of_scope`
- If `only_for_lot` is not "common" and doesn't match "44_fz", mark as `out_of_scope`
- If `only_for_terminal` is not "common" and doesn't match "pos" or "smart", mark as `out_of_scope`
- If `payment_method` is not "common" and doesn't match "card" or "qr", mark as `out_of_scope`

### Output format:
Write a fragment to `/outputs/working/fragment_batch2.json` with this structure:
```json
{
  "fragment_type": "matrix_batch",
  "assigned_matrix_ids": [...],
  "links": [...],
  "atomic_links": [...],
  "unmatched_matrix": [...],
  "coverage_ledger_matrix": [...]
}
```

Each `link` follows the output-contract schema:
- `matrix_ids`: array of matrix ids in this group
- `contract_ids`: array of contract locators (from registry, final_allowed=true)
- `relationship`: "aligned" or "deviation"
- `legal_topic`: short legal topic
- `matrix_standard`: bank standard requirement
- `contract_position`: contract position
- `matrix_evidence`: short matrix quote
- `contract_evidence`: short contract quote
- `evidence_locators`: []
- `status_reason`: group-level reason
- `risk_level`: "none", "low", "medium", "high"
- `covered_elements`: [...]
- `uncovered_elements`: [...]
- `candidate_contract_ids`: [...]
- `rejected_contract_ids`: [{"contract_id": "...", "reason": "..."}]
- `candidate_search_exhausted`: true
- `search_scope`: "full_contract"
- `discrepancies`: [{"type": "...", "description": "...", "risk": "..."}]

Each `atomic_link`:
- `matrix_id`, `contract_id`, `relationship`, `link_index`, `coverage_role`, `coverage`

Each `unmatched_matrix` item:
- `matrix_id`, `requirement`, `source_evidence`, `evidence_locators`, `status`: "missing_in_contract", `required_type`, `applicability`, `risk_level`, `risk`, `covered_elements`, `uncovered_elements`, `candidate_contract_ids`, `candidate_search_exhausted`, `search_scope`, `rejected_candidates`

Each `coverage_ledger_matrix` item:
- `matrix_id`, `closure`: "linked"|"missing_in_contract"|"out_of_scope"|"not_applicable", `link_indices`, `reason`

### Validation:
After writing the fragment, run:
```bash
python /skills/acquiring-discrepancy-analysis/scripts/validate_fragment.py /outputs/working/fragment_batch2.json --registry /outputs/working/contract_locator_registry.json --assigned-matrix-ids "4.2.8,4.2.9,4.2.10,4.2.11,4.2.12,4.2.13,4.2.14,4.2.15,4.2.16.1,4.2.16.2,4.2.16.3,4.2.17,4.2.18,4.2.19,4.2.20.1,4.2.20.2,4.2.20.3,4.2.20.4,4.2.20.5,4.2.20.6,4.2.20.7,4.2.21.1,4.2.21.2,4.2.21.3,4.2.21.4,4.2.21.5,4.2.21.6,4.2.21.7,4.2.21.8,4.2.22,4.2.23,4.2.24,4.2.25,4.2.26,5.1.1.1,5.1.1.2,5.1.1.3,5.1.1.4,5.1.1.5,5.1.1.6,5.1.2,5.1.3,5.1.4,5.1.5"
```

If validation fails, fix the errors and re-run until it passes. Return the validation result.

Tool:      1	---
     2	name: acquiring-discrepancy-analysis
     3	description: "Compare a bank acquiring standard matrix with a counterparty acquiring contract using bidirectional legal proposition coverage, group-level statuses, missing bank-standard requirements, and material contract-only terms."

     6	# Acquiring Discrepancy Analysis
     7	
     8	Use this skill to compare a Bank standard acquiring matrix with a counterparty
     9	acquiring contract. The matrix is the Bank standard. The contract is checked
    10	against that standard. The output is a many-to-many legal coverage graph plus a
    11	two-sheet review table generated from the JSON.
    12	
    13	Before finalization, read:
    14	
    15	- `references/output-contract.md` for artifact shape and field contracts.
    16	- `references/comparison-patterns.md` for calibration examples.
    17	- `references/delegation-contract.md` before delegating subagent work or merging
    18	  subagent fragments.
    19	
    20	## Purpose
    21	
    22	Find and explain:
    23	
    24	- Bank-standard matrix requirements preserved by the contract;
    25	- true analogues that deviate from the Bank standard;
    26	- applicable matrix requirements absent from the contract;
    27	- legally meaningful contract terms with no matrix analogue.
    28	- matrix requirements that are out of scope for the current contract profile,
    29	  closed in the internal ledger without final risk reporting.
    30	
    31	The review is risk-oriented. Missing a real risk is worse than marking a
    32	borderline issue as `deviation`, but weak thematic matches must not be promoted
    33	into legal links.
    34	
    35	## Inputs And Outputs
    36	
    37	Inputs:
    38	
    39	- `inputs/matrix.json`: Bank standard matrix. Use `number` as the matrix id.
    40	  Analyze `main_idea`, `topics`, `enriched_text`, obligation fields, and
    41	  applicability filters.
    42	- `inputs/contract.txt`: full counterparty contract text. Use printed clause
    43	  ids or real document locators visible in this file.
    44	
    45	Final outputs:
    46	
    47	- `/outputs/discrepancy_analysis.json`: source-of-truth machine artifact.
    48	- `/outputs/discrepancy_analysis.xlsx`: mechanical table export from JSON.
    49	
    50	Working artifacts belong under `/outputs/working/`.
    51	
    52	## Source Hierarchy
    53	
    54	Use the source text as the legal authority:
    55	
    56	1. Matrix `enriched_text`, `main_idea`, `topics`, and applicability fields.
    57	2. Contract clause text and real printed locators from `inputs/contract.txt`.
    58	3. Working ledgers as indexes and evidence aids.
    59	
    60	Do not decide status from extracted fields alone. When a status depends on a
    61	deadline, amount, penalty, party, trigger, procedure, channel, scope, or
    62	consequence, re-read the source text.
    63	
    64	## Required Artifacts And Contracts
    65	
    66	Create the artifacts in this order. Each later step depends on the earlier
    67	artifact contract.
    68	
    69	### 1. Source Preflight
    70	
    71	Check `inputs/contract.txt` before analysis:
    72	
    73	- real clause numbering is present;
    74	- deep clause numbers are not visibly collapsed or shifted;
    75	- repeated locators have enough context to distinguish source rows;
    76	- text is readable and not corrupted by encoding.
    77	
    78	If the contract text is not usable, stop and write
    79	`/outputs/working/source_preflight_error.json`. Do not run legal analysis on
    80	invalid text.
    81	
    82	### 2. Clause Index
    83	
    84	Create `/outputs/working/clause_index.json`.
    85	
    86	It is a source map only. It must include:
    87	
    88	- every matrix `number`;
    89	- every contract clause, operative parent, definition, appendix/table row, and
    90	  unnumbered operative provision;
    91	- source text or source locator for each row;
    92	- context for duplicate printed contract ids.
    93	
    94	Do not use `clause_index` to decide legal status. It only proves source
    95	coverage and valid ids. Never overwrite it with a batch subset.
    96	
    97	Also create `/outputs/working/contract_locator_registry.json` from the same
    98	source map. It is the closed list of source locators. Final `contract_id`
    99	values may use only registry rows with `final_allowed = true`. Appendix starts,
   100	table anchors, and unnumbered source anchors may be `evidence_only`; cite them
   101	through `evidence_locators`, not as final `contract_id` values.
   102	
   103	### 3. Legal Proposition Ledger
   104	
   105	Create `/outputs/working/legal_propositions.json`.
   106	
   107	This is the mandatory legal evidence ledger. It must contain `matrix` and
   108	`contract` arrays. Every evaluable proposition should include:
   109	
   110	- `id`: matrix number or printed contract locator;
   111	- `source_text`: text used for legal comparison;
   112	- `source_excerpt`: short quote supporting the normalized proposition;
   113	- `type`: `operative`, `definition`, `heading`, `parent_framework`,
   114	  `appendix`, `table`, or `technical`;
   115	- `materiality`: `evaluable`, `not_material`, `heading`, or `needs_source_review`;
   116	- `protected_party`, `bound_party`;
   117	- `right_or_obligation`;
   118	- `legal_object`;
   119	- `trigger`;
   120	- `deadline`;
   121	- `amount_formula_cap`;
   122	- `procedure_channel`;
   123	- `liability_remedy`;
   124	- `scope_options`;
   125	- `consequence`;
   126	- `applicability_filters` where available.
   127	
   128	If a legally meaningful row cannot be normalized, mark it
   129	`needs_source_review` and explain the missing element. It is not fully
   130	processed until the source text has been reviewed. Do not proceed to final
   131	matching with unresolved source-review rows that could affect status.
   132	
   133	The ledger is an evidence table, not a substitute for the source. Matching may
   134	use it to find candidates. Status must still be confirmed against source text.
   135	
   136	Run the mechanical check before matching:
   137	
   138	```bash
   139	python skills/acquiring-discrepancy-analysis/scripts/validate_working_artifacts.py --matrix inputs/matrix.json --contract inputs/contract.txt --working outputs/working
   140	```
   141	
   142	Fix invalid working artifacts before delegating comparison work.
   143	When delegating, follow `references/delegation-contract.md`. Validate every
   144	subagent fragment before merge:
   145	
   146	```bash
   147	python skills/acquiring-discrepancy-analysis/scripts/validate_fragment.py <fragment-path> --registry outputs/working/contract_locator_registry.json
   148	```
   149	
   150	### 4. Contract Product Profile
   151	
   152	Create `/outputs/working/contract_product_profile.json`.
   153	
   154	Extract from the contract:
   155	
   156	- product and payment channels;
   157	- lot/procurement type;
   158	- terminal/payment-device scope;
   159	- payment methods;
   160	- legal regime (`44_fz`, `223_fz`, `commercial`, `common`, or `unknown`).
   161	
   162	Apply matrix filters before status:
   163	
   164	- `common` applies to every contract.
   165	- A filtered matrix item applies only when the profile matches
   166	  `only_for_product`, `only_for_lot`, `only_for_terminal`, or `payment_method`.
   167	- Mandatory applicable missing = high risk.
   168	- Out-of-scope / non-applicable matrix items are not final risks. Close them in
   169	  `coverage_ledger.matrix` as `out_of_scope` or `not_applicable` with a short
   170	  profile-based reason. Do not put them in final `unmatched_matrix`.
   171	- Optional applicable missing = low or conditional risk.
   172	- Slash-separated alternatives are options unless the matrix says all options
   173	  are mandatory.
   174	- Placeholder or blank in an applicable material term = low-risk `deviation`.
   175	
   176	## Analogue Threshold
   177	
   178	Create a final link only when the contract proposition is a true legal analogue
   179	of the matrix proposition. Test:
   180	
   181	- same or equivalent protected party;
   182	- same or equivalent bound party;
   183	- same legal object;
   184	- same operative right, duty, prohibition, permission, remedy, or allocation of
   185	  risk;
   186	- material trigger, scope, procedure, and consequence are the same or legally
   187	  equivalent.
   188	
   189	Reject weak thematic candidates. A clause about the same broad topic is not a
   190	legal analogue when it governs a different object, party, trigger, procedure,
   191	or consequence.
   192	
   193	## Bidirectional Matching
   194	
   195	Perform both directions.
   196	
   197	Matrix to contract:
   198	
   199	- for each applicable evaluable matrix proposition, retrieve all contract
   200	  clauses that collectively cover the Bank-standard requirement;
   201	- include parent, child, appendix, payment, procedure, liability, and framework
   202	  clauses only when they provide material coverage or legally cure a gap.
   203	- if a child clause is selected, check whether its parent carries operative
   204	  legal meaning for the same topic; if a parent is selected, check whether its
   205	  children contain the material elements;
   206	- for payment, acceptance, liability, termination, and document-exchange
   207	  requirements, keep the legal package together: operative clause, basis,
   208	  deadline, procedure, remedy, consequence, and any incorporated appendix/table
   209	  row that changes coverage;
   210	- a framework or legal-compliance clause may be a standalone analogue only when
   211	  it carries the same legal object or allocates the same risk, duty, or remedy.
   212	
   213	Contract to matrix:
   214	
   215	- for each evaluable contract proposition, find the matrix analogue group;
   216	- if none exists and the term has independent legal effect, classify it as
   217	  `extra_in_contract`;
   218	- if it is non-operative, close it as `not_material` only in the ledger.
   219	
   220	Group related ids into many-to-many `links`. One matrix id may need several
   221	contract clauses. One contract clause may cover several matrix ids.
   222	
   223	### Uncovered Element Closure Rule
   224	
   225	For every applicable evaluable matrix item, identify the material provisions
   226	that must be covered: party, legal object, duty/right, trigger, deadline,
   227	amount, formula, cap, penalty, scope, procedure, channel, liability, remedy,
   228	exception, and consequence.
   229	
   230	If any material provision remains uncovered after the first candidates are
   231	found, continue candidate search across the full contract index before
   232	finalizing status. This rule applies to both `missing_in_contract` and
   233	`deviation`.
   234	
   235	Document the closure for each final matrix-side finding:
   236	
   237	- `covered_elements`: provisions actually covered by final contract candidates;
   238	- `uncovered_elements`: provisions still missing, changed, narrowed, or
   239	  weakened;
   240	- `candidate_contract_ids`: contract clauses accepted as true analogues or
   241	  package candidates;
   242	- `rejected_contract_ids`: clauses reviewed but rejected, with short legal
   243	  reasons;
   244	- `candidate_search_exhausted`: `true` only after all contract clauses have
   245	  been checked through `clause_index` / `legal_propositions`;
   246	- `search_scope`: `full_contract`, `targeted_domain`, or `not_completed`.
   247	- `evidence_locators`: registry evidence-only anchors, if a cited appendix or
   248	  table supports the source evidence but is not itself a final contract clause.
   249	
   250	Status rules for the closure:
   251	
   252	- `aligned` is allowed only when `uncovered_elements` is empty.
   253	- `deviation` is allowed only when true analogue candidates exist and the
   254	  remaining changed/missing provisions were not cured by any other contract
   255	  clause after a full-contract sweep.
   256	- `missing_in_contract` is allowed only when the full-contract sweep found no
   257	  true analogue.
   258	- `candidate_search_exhausted = false` or `search_scope = not_completed` means
   259	  the matrix item is not ready for final output.
   260	
   261	Keep the sweep efficient. Use `clause_index` and `legal_propositions` to scan
   262	all clauses. Re-read source text only for plausible candidates, hard terms, and
   263	rejected clauses whose legal object is close enough to need explanation.
   264	
   265	## Group-Level Status
   266	
   267	Assign status to the group, not to each atomic pair.
   268	
   269	- `aligned`: the contract package preserves the matrix legal result.
   270	- `deviation`: a true analogue exists, but any material element is changed,
   271	  narrowed, weakened, omitted, shifted, or blank.
   272	- `missing_in_contract`: no true contract analogue exists for an applicable
   273	  matrix requirement.
   274	- `extra_in_contract`: a legally meaningful contract proposition has no matrix
   275	  analogue.
   276	- `not_material`: internal ledger closure only; exclude from final report.
   277	- `out_of_scope` / `not_applicable`: internal matrix closure only; exclude from
   278	  final report because the requirement does not apply to the current product,
   279	  lot, terminal, payment method, or legal regime.
   280	
   281	Material elements include party, legal object, operative act, trigger,
   282	deadline, amount, formula, cap, penalty, scope, procedure, channel, liability,
   283	remedy, exception, Bank right, merchant duty, and consequence.
   284	
   285	Hard terms must be compared directly:
   286	
   287	- same material deadline/amount/procedure in the same legal obligation can be
   288	  `aligned`;
   289	- changed value or missing value is `deviation`;
   290	- a hard term from another clause counts only when that clause expressly
   291	  governs the same obligation or is explicitly incorporated;
   292	- a neighboring date, amount, or procedure for another legal object cannot cure
   293	  the gap.
   294	
   295	Do not downgrade for formal differences alone: heading, title, appendix label,
   296	permitted option selection, equivalent mandatory-law mechanism, or wording
   297	style.
   298	
   299	Do not downgrade for low-risk notes when the legal result is preserved. If the
   300	reason says the difference is merely terminological, beneficial to the Bank,
   301	already incorporated through another clause, or caused only by a mandatory
   302	44-FZ/EIS mechanism that preserves the Bank's practical right, keep `aligned`.
   303	
   304	44-FZ/EIS procedure is not a deviation by itself. It becomes `deviation` only
   305	when it materially worsens or changes a Bank-standard term: payment timing,
   306	acceptance control, withholding right, penalty/cap, termination power, protected
   307	party, evidence channel, or enforceability.
   308	
   309	Liability, penalty, cap, and remedy provisions must be reviewed as a group.
   310	Before marking a liability group `aligned`, check the amount, formula, cap,
   311	trigger, protected party, excluded delay/non-delay buckets, and claim procedure
   312	across the whole package.
   313	
   314	## Risk Calibration
   315	
   316	Use `risk_level` consistently:
   317	
   318	- `none`: only for `aligned`;
   319	- `low`: optional applicable missing, placeholder, formal but legally manageable
   320	  gap;
   321	- `medium`: material deviation that can affect performance, evidence, payment,
   322	  control, liability, or enforceability;
   323	- `high`: mandatory missing, changed protected party, major payment/remedy
   324	  change, important Bank right omitted, or broad contract-only risk.
   325	
   326	Every `deviation`, `missing_in_contract`, and `extra_in_contract` must include
   327	a short evidence-based reason. Use concise quotes rather than long excerpts.
   328	
   329	## Final QA
   330	
   331	Before writing final artifacts:
   332	
   333	- verify `clause_index` covers all source ids;
   334	- verify `legal_proposition_ledger` has no unresolved
   335	  `needs_source_review` rows that can affect final status;
   336	- verify every matrix id is closed as `linked`, `missing_in_contract`,
   337	  `out_of_scope`, `not_applicable`, or source-based `not_evaluable` in
   338	  `coverage_ledger`;
   339	- verify every applicable evaluable matrix id is linked or in
   340	  `unmatched_matrix`;
   341	- verify every final matrix-side link or missing row has exhausted candidate
   342	  search evidence: covered/uncovered elements, accepted candidates, rejected
   343	  close candidates, and `candidate_search_exhausted = true`;
   344	- verify out-of-scope / non-applicable matrix ids are not in final
   345	  `unmatched_matrix`;
   346	- verify every material contract id is closed as linked or extra;
   347	- verify `coverage_ledger` is derived from final `links`,
   348	  `unmatched_matrix`, and `unmatched_contract`;
   349	- verify every final id is visible in source text;
   350	- verify `aligned` has no material discrepancy;
   351	- verify every `deviation` has a named legal gap and evidence;
   352	- verify weak candidates are not in final `links`;
   353	- verify non-material contract rows are absent from final `unmatched_contract`;
   354	- verify summary counts equal final arrays.
   355	
   356	## Output Discipline
   357	
   358	Follow `references/output-contract.md`.
   359	
   360	Final contract locators are closed-class values. Do not invent corrected,
   361	translated, parenthetical, semantic, or derived appendix ids such as
   362	`Приложение_1_п5`. If the source location is an appendix/table anchor rather
   363	than a contract clause, put it in `evidence_locators` and link the nearest real
   364	final-allowed contract clause only when it provides material coverage.
   365	
   366	The final JSON must contain:
   367	
   368	- `analysis_profile`
   369	- `links`
   370	- `atomic_links`
   371	- `unmatched_matrix`
   372	- `unmatched_contract`
   373	- `coverage_ledger`
   374	- `summary`
   375	
   376	`links` carry group-level legal findings. `atomic_links` are traceability
   377	projections only and must inherit the group relationship. Do not assign
   378	separate final pair-level statuses.
   379	
   380	## Tools And Scripts
   381	
   382	Use helper scripts for mechanical work: source extraction, indexing,
   383	normalization checks, batch completeness, coverage validation, JSON schema
   384	checks, and Excel export. Do not put legal mapping or status decisions into
   385	hardcoded scripts.
